quadrant + other cartography work

crownheights-quads.geosjon = a collection of 4 geoJSON features, 4 polygons that represent the quadrants we've divided the neighborhood into.  The N/S line is Eastern Parkway and the E/W line is Troy Ave. They each have a corresponding id (nw,ne,se,sw) and are color-coded by their "fill" property. 

the geoJSON features collection is added to a Mapbox Studio style as a layer, you can preview this here: https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mab253/ck8adesvs0ya01inzfb742514.html?fresh=true&title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFiMjUzIiwiYSI6IlBfal9DblUifQ.D-hAe_W0jfTNfU3pj4lH5w#14.53/40.67166/-73.94147
